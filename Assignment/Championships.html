        The National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals is the championship
        series for the NBA and the conclusion of its postseason. All Finals have
        been played in a best-of-seven format, and are contested between the
        winners of the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference (formerly
        Divisions before 1970), except in 1950 when the Eastern Division
        champion faced the winner between the Western and Central Division
        champions. From 1946 through 1949, when the league was known as the
        Basketball Association of America (BAA), the playoffs were a three-stage
        tournament where the two semifinal winners played each other in the
        finals. The winning team of the series receives the Larry O'Brien
        Championship Trophy. The current home-and-away format in the NBA Finals
        is 2–2–1–1–1 (the team with the better regular-season record plays on
        their home court in Games 1, 2, 5, and 7), which has been used in
        1947–1948, 1950–1952, 1957–1970, 1972–1974, 1976–1977, 1979–1984, and
        2014–present. It was previously in a 2–3–2 format (the team with the
        better regular season record plays on their home court in Games 1, 2, 6,
        and 7) during 1949, 1953–1955, and 1985–2013, in a 1–1–1–1–1–1–1 format
        during 1956 and 1971, and in a 1–2–2–1–1 format during 1975 and 1978.
        The Eastern Conference/Division leads the Western Conference/Division in
        series won (39–34). The defunct Central Division, in existence during
        the 1949–50 NBA season when the NBA was divided into three divisions and
        different from the current Central Division created in 1970 when the
        then existing Eastern Division was upgraded as a conference, won one
        championship. The Boston Celtics and the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers
        alone own almost half of the titles, having won a combined 33 of 73
        championships. As of 2019, the defending champions are the Toronto
        Raptors, making history as the first team from outside of the United
        States to win.
